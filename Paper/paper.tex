\title{Continuous room localization using painting detection}
\author{Bert De Saffel, Timothy Thiecke}
\begin{document}
	\maketitle
	\begin{abstract}
		This paper describes a localisation method based on paintings from a museum, in this particular case The Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent. The method consists of three parts. The first part is painting segmentation which attempts to detect a painting from an arbitrary video frame using painting contours and a bounding box and transforms this painting into a standard format such that it can be used for analysis. The second part considers the transformed image and uses a brute-force ORB \cite{Rublee2011} matcher to detect key features and descriptors. These features are matched against a database using a linear lookup method. The third step uses the information of the painting, which contains the room it is located in, to mark it on a ground plan of the museum.
