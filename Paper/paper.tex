	\subsection{Painting Segmentation}
	Before a painting can be matched against the database it must first be recognized in an arbitrary frame.

	\subsection{Path Tracking}
	Once a painting is identified and matched, it can be localised on the ground plan. To achieve this, the ground plan is converted into a directed graph. The nodes of this graph are the rooms of the museum and the edges define the connections between rooms. When a user starts recording paintings, the matching algorithm will be performed on each frame and a location will be found. The graph is able to mark nodes in three distinct ways. A green node is the start of the path, an orange node is an intermediate path and the blue node is the end of the path. The path ends when the user stops recording. The path direction is also visualised by coloring the corresponding edges green. Note that when a cyclic path occurs which was walked in both directions, information of order is lost.
	
	
	
	
	To illustrate the path tracking algorithm,  a small segment consisting of rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 are converted into such a graph and is show on figure \ref{fig:groundplan_msk_simple_graph}.

	\subsection{Database}
	The database consists of 688 images of various paintings and sculptures in the museum. In this work we only focus on the paintings of this dataset. The paintings were extracted from two different camera's: a Nokia 7 plus and a Samsung A3. Each image also contains the room in which it resides as metadata.  
	
	To reduce the load time of this database, a prebuilding stage was implemented. This stage reduces each image to a collection of interest points and corresponding descriptors for these interest points as generated by the ORB \cite{Rublee2011} algorithm.
