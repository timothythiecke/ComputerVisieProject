\section{Evaluation}
	To measure the performance metrics of our algorithm, we employ three different methods: for painting segmentation, the matching algorithm and room localization consistency. First, an evaluation of painting segmentation is done using a random sample of the dataset. In this sample, each painting is segmented manually, resulting in four coordinates for each image. These coordinates can be compared against the coordinates that are generated by the painting segmentation algorithm. A distance metric is used to compare the closeness of two coordinates.
	
	The matching algorithm has to be evaluated manually by comparing the matcher's result. The correctness of the matching algorithm is simply the ratio of the correct matches against the false matches.
	
	To evaluate the room localization, a sample of the video dataset was taken. The generated path is compared against the actual path.
