\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
This section describes the experimental results of the final recognition system. It includes the performance of the individual steps: painting segmentation, the matching algorithm and room localization. 


\subsection{Dataset}
The main dataset consists of 688 pictures of all art items in the museum which functions as a database. These pictures are taken at eye-level height and each picture contains one or multiple art items. One part of the dataset is taken with a Nokia 7 Plus camera, which offers a base resolution of 3024 by 4032 pixels and the other part is taken with a Samsung A3 2016, which offers a base resolution of 3096 by 4128 pixels. All pictures in the dataset are compressed to 1000 x 1000 pixels. To reduce the load time of this dataset, a prebuilding stage was implemented. This stage reduces each image to a collection of interest points and corresponding descriptors for these interest points as generated by the ORB \cite{Rublee2011} algorithm. 

\subsection{Testset}
Apart from the dataset, two different testing sets exist to evaluate the algorithm. The first testing contains still images of various shots at the museum. This dataset contains more difficult examples such as steep angles or hard to detect paintings. A random sample ($n = 30$) was selected and labeled manually. This first testset is used to evaluate the segmentation and matching part. A second testing set are various videos which emulates a person recording paintings while moving trough the museum. Similar to the first testset, a small segment (1 minute) of the video was taken and labeled manually. This last testset is used to evaluate path tracking.

\subsection{Segmentation Accuracy}
The random sample from the testset was first manually segmented to indicate a perfect segmentation. This results in 4 coordinates of a polygon which represent the ideal polygon. Afterwards, the segmentation is done automatically by the algorithm, which also gives four coordinates of a polygon. To illustrate, both polygons are shown on figure \ref{fig:painting_segmentation_validation_1}.
To measure the similarity of these two polygons, and thus the correctness of the segmentation, we first calculate the intersection area $A_i$ and the area of the ideal polygon $A_{pi}$. The ratio of $A_i$ to $A_{pi}$ describes the closeness of two polygons with 100\% being a perfect match and 0\% meaning there is no intersection at all between the two polygons. There is one case where this statistic does not work. When the ideal polygon is fully enclosed by the predicted polygon, $A_i$ will be equal to $A_{pi}$, resulting in a fake perfect match. To prevent this, the roles of the green and red polygon are switched such that we now consider the area of the predicted polygon, $A_{pp}$, instead of $A_{pi}$.

Using this metric, the segmentation method achieves 88.57\% correctness score. Due to the use of the Canny edge detector, the segmentation works fairly well when the painting frame and the background wall differ greatly in color intensity. Problems start to arise when shadows are visible (figure \ref{fig:negative_case_shadow}) or when the painting frame is not fully visible. In the former case, the shadow and the background wall also differ in color intensity, resulting in an edge. These edges usually extend the painting frames and because the contour with the largest area is sought after, the segmentation step will include the shadow as part of the painting.

\subsection{Matching Accuracy}
The matching algorithm has to be evaluated manually by comparing the matcher's result. The correctness of the matching algorithm is simply the ratio of the correct matches against the false matches.

To evaluate the room localization, a sample of the video dataset was taken. The generated path is compared against the actual path.

	\todo{qualititative: technisch, show where and why the method succeeds or fails, pictures of easy and difficulty cases}
	
	Because our method relies heavily on edge detection, there are cases where this could have a negative impact. In many cases, there is a shadow underneath the painting, as shown on figure \ref{fig:negative_case_shadow}.

This subsection, we will present a qualitative analysis of our algorithm. We will discuss its strengths, flaws and, with each point, present an example case to help as a visual aid. The flaws in particular help paint a picture of what can be done better in a future iteration of the algorithm. 
e do not deny its usefulness and believe that it may be beneficial to implement it in a future version of the algorithm \todo{waar nodig?, kan zijn dat ML gebruikt wordt bij matching}. Even though the algorithm's simplicity is presented as one of its strengths, it can also be considered as one of its weaknesses, much like a double edged sword.

ion phase detects such a painting and supplies it to the matching phase. A cascade of erroneous matches and room localizations may occur. The inverse is also true, as having an entry in the data set with few keypoints can result in a painting with many keypoints being wrongfully matched with a 'flat' one.
