\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work we discussed three parts: a painting segmentation technique, a matching technique and the localisation method. Painting segmentation is achieved using a Canny edge detection combined with finding contours. Due to canny edge detection, frames are also included as part of the painting. The extracted paintings are supplied to a brute-force ORB matcher which detects key features and descriptors from the paintings. The matching happens in a linear fashion, resulting in a slow execution speed, which was solved using multi-threading and reducing the dataset size. Both the segmentation and matching are subpar, scoring respectively 47.10\% and 46.7\% accuracy. Due to this low accuracy, the localisation step is deemed not trustworthy to be used.

The current implementation of the algorithm uses a per-frame matching technique. Using a buffer and applying e.g. majority voting or weighted voting could increase the accuracy of the matching method.
