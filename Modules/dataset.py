"""
Dataset needs to be persistent as creation takes about 2-3 minutes during each build phase
Data set layout
    Array of arrays
    Each array corresponds to information associated with a painting and contains information in the following layout:
    [ room/directory of painting : str, filename : str, array of keypoints, array of descriptors]
    example:
    [
        ['zaal_A', '20190323_111313.jpg', [ keypoint1, keypoint2, ...], [descriptor1, descriptor2, ...]], 
        ['zaal_B', ..., [...], [...]],
        [...]
    ]

We save the keypoints and descriptors here to save time during the matching phase, as matching is a lot faster than
detecting keypoints and are invariant.
Saving painting directory and name takes up a lot less memory as we only need to show an image when a match is
detected
